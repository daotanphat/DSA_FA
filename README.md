In src -> Day 8:
The office area of Company X is divided into square cells, each containing a positive integer representing asset value. One day, a fire starts in up to three cells (1 <= K <= 3). The fire spreads to adjacent cells in four directions—up, down, left, right—and reduces the asset value in each burning cell by one every second. The fire only spreads to cells containing assets and stops when a cell's value reaches zero, turning it into an empty cell. The task is to determine at which moment the total cells burned is the highest and to print this total value along with the time step at which it occurs. If a fire starts at cells (1,7), (4,4), and (6,5) at step 0, and the maximum burned cells of 11 occurs at step 2, the output should be "11 2". This indicates a sum of 11 and a time step of 2.
